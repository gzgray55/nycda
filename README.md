Assignment 3 for Gordon Gray

I struggled with git.  Had to use git push --force to successfully upload files.

My intial experiments resulted in unintended files getting pushed to the root of master.  Wasnt sure how
to replace these with good files so I created a new directory and pushed this.

The new directory is named "image3"  and the main webpage is:

image3a.html


This has the double columns and fixed link that takes you to another website with a link to facebook.

Didnt quite finish the complete assignment but ran out of time:)  It was all I could do to get git going.

I did successfully create ssh public and private keys and added pub key to gitrepo but havent used it yet.

I am including this as a readme.txt -- wasnt sure how to create a readme.md at the directory level.

There is a readme.md at the master parent level and I have updated that too. (if you access this please discard
files at that level and access the /image3 directory for my assignment.

Thanks,
